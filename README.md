[selfh.st/icons](https://selfh.st/icons) is a collection of logos and icons for self-hosted (and non-self-hosted) software.

The collection is available for browsing via the directory at [selfh.st/icons](https://selfh.st/icons) and served to users directly from this repo using the jsDelivr content delivery network.

To self-host the collection, users should refer to the [repository's wiki](https://github.com/selfhst/icons/wiki).

## Formats

When available, SVG icons are used as the starting point for all icon formats. Otherwise, PNG is used.

| Format | Availability |
| --- | :---: |
| SVG  | Most |
| PNG | All |
| WebP | All |
| AVIF | All |
| ICO<sup>1</sup> | All |

<sup>1</sup>Includes the following sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128

## Custom Colors

By default, the directory provides SVG icons (when available) in standard, dark, and light colors. Users looking to display the icons using colors of their choice can become a [paid member of selfh.st](https://selfh.st/perks) or [deploy the collection themselves](https://github.com/selfhst/icons/wiki).
